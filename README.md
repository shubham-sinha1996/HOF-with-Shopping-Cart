## Shopping Cart with Currency Conversion

This JavaScript project demonstrates how to use Higher-Order Functions to compute the changed currency cost while rendering a shopping cart list. The shopping cart includes the total cost and quantity of items, making it an efficient system for dynamic currency conversion.

## Features

- Dynamic shopping cart rendering.
- Currency conversion functionality for various currencies.
- Real-time updates to total price and quantity of items in the cart.
- Utilizes higher-order functions for managing data transformations and currency conversion.

## Higher-Order Functions Overview

Higher-order functions (HOFs) are functions that take other functions as arguments or return a function as a result. In this project:

- map() is used to create a new array of products with the updated prices based on the currency conversion rate.
  reduce() is used to accumulate the total price and quantity of items in the cart.
- By utilizing HOFs, we efficiently manipulate arrays of products and compute costs in various currencies without writing redundant code.
